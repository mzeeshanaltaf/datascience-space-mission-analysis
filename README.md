# datascience-space-mission-analysis
Analysis of Space Missions using Python Pandas Library. The datasheet used here is scrapped from [Next Space Flight](nextspaceflight.com) and includes all the space missions since the beginning of Space Race between the USA and the Soviet Union in 1957 till date (Feb 2024)

## Setup
To access files, use any of the below options:
* Fork this repo and then clone it locally.
* Click the green "clone or download" button and then click "Download ZIP". You can thenextract all of the files to the location you want to edit your code.

## Information
Python Pandas and Plotly is used to explore and analyze space missions data. Notebook has following sections:
* Installation & importing the Packages
* Data Loading
* Preliminary Data Exloration
* Data Cleaning
* Data Extraction
* Analysis of Space Missions

In the final section, Analysis of Space Missions, following questions were addressed and analyzed using chart like (line chart, bar chart, Pie, Sunburst, Choropleth Map etc):
1. Number of space mission launches by organisation
2. Number of Active vs Retired Rockets
3. Distribution of Mission Status
4. How Expensive are the Launches
5. Use a Choropleth Map to Show the Number of Launches by Country
6. Use a Choropleth Map to Show the Number of Failures by Country
7. Create a Plotly Sunburst Chart of the countries, organisations, and mission status
8. Analyse the Total Amount of Money Spent by Organisation on Space Missions
9. Analyse the Amount of Money Spent by Organisation per Launch
10. Chart the Number of Launches Month-on-Month until the Present
11. How has the Launch Price varied Over Time?
12. Chart the Number of Launches over Time by the Top 10 Organisations
13. Create a YoY chart showing the total number of launches per Country
14. For Every Year Show which Country was in the Lead in terms of Total Number of Launches up to and including including 2024)
15. Create a Year-on-Year Chart Showing the Organisation Doing the Most Number of Launches
16. Create a Plotly Pie Chart comparing the total number of launches of the USSR and the USA
17. Create a Chart that Shows the Total Number of Launches Year-On-Year by the Two Superpowers
18. Chart the Total Number of Mission Failures Year on Year.
19. Chart the Percentage of Failures over Time
